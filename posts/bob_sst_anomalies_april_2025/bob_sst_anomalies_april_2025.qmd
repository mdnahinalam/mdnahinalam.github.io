This SST anomaly map shows how much warmer or cooler the Bay of Bengal’s surface was in April 2025 compared to the long-term average (based on a 2015–2024 climatological baseline).

🌊 What happened in April 2025?

Using daily SST data from NOAA at 0.25° resolution, I calculated and visualized anomalies across the Bay of Bengal using R.

-   ✅ April 1 started slightly warm: +0.13°C

-   📉 By April 12, anomalies dropped to -0.57°C

-   📆 From April 8–29, the ocean stayed consistently cooler than normal

-   📈 Mean Daily Anomalies ranged from+0.18°C → -0.57°C over the month.

-   🛠️ Tools: R programming

-   📡 Data: NOAA OISST

-   🗺️ Resolution: 0.25°
